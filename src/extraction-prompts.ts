# Memory Extraction Criteria

## What is worth remembering?
- Personalized information: Information specific to this user, not general domain knowledge
- Long-term validity: Information that will still be useful in future sessions
- Specific and clear: Has concrete details, not vague generalizations

## What is NOT worth remembering?
- General knowledge that anyone would know
- System/platform metadata: message IDs, sender IDs, timestamps, channel info, JSON envelopes (e.g. "System: [timestamp] Feishu...", "message_id", "sender_id", "ou_xxx") — these are infrastructure noise, NEVER extract them
- Temporary information: One-time questions or conversations
- Vague information: "User has questions about a feature" (no specific details)
- Tool output, error logs, or boilerplate
- Runtime scaffolding or orchestration wrappers such as "[Subagent Context]", "[Subagent Task]", bootstrap wrappers, task envelopes, or agent instructions — these are execution metadata, NEVER store them as memories
- Recall queries / meta-questions: "Do you remember X?", "你还记得X吗?", "你知道我喜欢什么吗" — these are retrieval requests, NOT new information to store
- Degraded or incomplete references: If the user mentions something vaguely ("that thing I said"), do NOT invent details or create a hollow memory
- Raw conversation carryover: quoted or attributed transcript blocks, especially 3+ lines of speaker text, are not memories by themselves. Distill a concrete profile detail, preference, entity state, event, case, or pattern from them, or skip.
- System/runtime artifacts: content containing "System:", compaction notices, model-switch/session-reset traces, tool-call transcripts, raw JSON blobs, or similar internal execution traces must be rejected unless a clean user fact can be extracted.
- Fragment blobs: mixed filename shards, code snippets, metadata fields, or partial sentences that look like unprocessed context fragments should be skipped rather than preserved.
- Atomic memory shape: each stored memory must read like one durable fact, preference, decision, entity state, event, case, or reusable pattern. If a candidate reads like an excerpt, log, or raw transcript, compress it into one atomic statement, or skip it.
- Length/distillation gate: if a candidate is longer than about 200 characters and reads like raw conversation instead of a distilled insight, rewrite it as a single factual statement before storing; if that is not possible, skip it.

## Assistant (bot) self-statements — persona boundary (chiguo deployment rule)
- This deployment is a persona chat bot (迟菓 talking with 哥哥). Store facts about the USER (哥哥) and real shared events/agreements only.
- NEVER extract the assistant's own persona/behavior/style: its self-descriptions, catchphrases, tsundere mannerisms, roleplay lines, or emotional performance — the persona definition lives in the personality files, not the memory store.
- Skip improv/roleplay content unless it encodes a concrete user fact or a real agreed commitment between user and assistant (e.g. "说好周末吃火锅" is an agreed event; "我迟菓才不会哭呢" is persona performance, skip).
- Prefer the USER's messages as the primary source; use assistant messages only to disambiguate what the user meant or to confirm agreements.

# Memory Classification

## Core Decision Logic

| Question | Answer | Category |
|----------|--------|----------|
| Who is the user? | Identity, attributes | profile |
| What does the user prefer? | Preferences, habits | preferences |
| What is this thing? | Person, project, organization | entities |
| What happened? | Decision, milestone | events |
| How was it solved? | Problem + solution | cases |
| What is the process? | Reusable steps | patterns |

## Precise Definition

**profile** - User identity (static attributes). Test: "User is..."
**preferences** - User preferences (tendencies). Test: "User prefers/likes..."
**entities** - Continuously existing nouns. Test: "XXX's state is..."
**events** - Things that happened. Test: "XXX did/completed..."
**cases** - Problem + solution pairs. Test: Contains "problem -> solution"
**patterns** - Reusable processes. Test: Can be used in "similar situations"

## Common Confusion
- "Plan to do X" -> events (action, not entity)
- "Project X status: Y" -> entities (describes entity)
- "User prefers X" -> preferences (not profile)
- "Encountered problem A, used solution B" -> cases (not events)
- "General process for handling certain problems" -> patterns (not cases)
- "Switched my commute to the M4" / "Spanish lesson before breakfast" -> preferences or patterns, not events: a change that creates a new routine or a lasting state is the user's new normal, not a one-off occurrence. Reserve events for genuinely one-off happenings.

# Conversational Grounding

A conversation carries two kinds of content. Factual content is actual, real, and certain — it describes the actual user and the real world. Hypothetical content is supposed, imagined, speculative, conjectural, or fictional — it holds only inside a "what if", a premise, a thought experiment, or a made-up situation. Never store hypothetical content as a fact about the user.

Judge grounding in two steps: first judge the register of the whole conversation and mark its hypothetical stretches; then tag each memory item on its own.

## Step 1 — Conversation register and its stretches

Judge the register over the whole conversation you just read. It is a property of the conversation, not of any single message. Set the top-level "conversation_register" field.

| conversation_register | Meaning |
|-----------------------|---------|
| "real" | Every part is factual: about the actual user and the real world. |
| "fiction" | The whole conversation sits inside one hypothetical frame: a what-if question, a supposed premise, a thought experiment, or a made-up situation. |
| "mixed" | Factual content and hypothetical content appear together — for example, a genuine real-life aside dropped into a made-up situation, or a real fact stated beside a supposed one. |

The label "fiction" covers every hypothetical frame, not only openly invented ones. A quiet what-if question or a casual thought experiment is just as hypothetical as an obvious imagined one, and is judged the same way.

If the register is "fiction" or "mixed", mark to yourself — before tagging anything — which stretches of the conversation are hypothetical and which are factual. A stretch turns hypothetical the moment the user pretends, imagines a situation, supposes a premise, or speaks as if from inside a made-up situation instead of as themselves about the real world (or asks you to do the same). It turns factual again only when the user drops that frame — an explicit real-life aside, or a clear return to reality. Everything from the opening of a hypothetical stretch to its close is inside the frame, including every everyday-sounding detail in it — a preference, a belonging, a habit, a name. An ordinary detail spoken from inside a made-up situation belongs to that situation, not to the real user.

## Step 2 — Per-item grounding (one tag per memory)

If conversation_register is "real", the whole conversation is factual: tag every memory "real" and extract normally, exactly as you would with no frame at all. The checks in the rest of this step apply only when the register is "fiction" or "mixed".

Grounding is about the CLAIM itself, not about how factual it sounds. Tag every memory's "grounding" field.

For each item, find the stretch of conversation the claim comes from.
- If that stretch is a hypothetical one you marked in Step 1 -> "constructed", even if the claim by itself sounds like an ordinary real-life fact.
- If that stretch is a factual one -> "real", once you confirm the claim still stands on its own there.

| grounding | Meaning |
|-----------|---------|
| "real" | The claim comes from a factual stretch and is true about the real user or the real world on its own. |
| "constructed" | The claim comes from a hypothetical stretch: it is supposed, imagined, speculative, or conjectural, and is not a fact about the actual user. |

One-line rule: **about-the-hypothetical is real; within-the-hypothetical is constructed.**

Rules:
- The premise of a question is not a fact. A message that supposes something in order to ask about it asserts nothing actual about the user. Tag anything taken from the premise "constructed".
- A claim from a hypothetical stretch stays "constructed" even when the user really typed it, even when it sounds ordinary, and even after you distill it into one clean sentence. Distilling supposed content does not make it real; the tidy sentence still describes something from inside the frame. Tag by which stretch the claim comes from, not by how factual the summary reads.
- Do not lift any within-frame detail — an imagined possession, an imagined situation, a supposed preference or trait — into profile, preferences, entities, cases, or patterns as if it were true. If you record it at all, tag it "constructed".
- Do not store a generalized taste for the made-up. An item that says the user likes, enjoys, or is interested in supposed, imagined, or made-up activity is speculative — tag it "constructed". That the user did such a thing once is a real event (next rule); that they "enjoy" or "prefer" it is an inference, not a stated fact.
- A genuine factual aside stays "real", even when it sits in the middle of a hypothetical stretch. Extract it normally under its natural category. It is real because it comes from a factual stretch the user stepped into, not because it sits near the frame.
- A note THAT the real user explored a hypothetical is itself "real" — a true statement about what happened in the real session. Record it as an "events" item with grounding "real". Keep it as a one-time event; do not restate it as a durable preference or trait.
- If you are genuinely unsure about a single item, default to "constructed". A wrongly stored fact is worse than a missed one, and anything important can still be saved deliberately later.

Check before you answer (only when the register is "fiction" or "mixed"): for every item you tagged "real", name to yourself the factual stretch it rests on — the real-life words the user said as themselves about the real world. If you cannot name one, change it to "constructed". Exception: a note that the session explored a hypothetical stays "real" because the exploring really happened; but an item about the user liking or enjoying made-up activity is not such a note — tag it "constructed".

# Three-Level Structure

Each memory contains three levels:

**abstract (L0)**: One-liner index
- Merge types (preferences/entities/profile/patterns): \`[Merge key]: [Description]\`
- Independent types (events/cases): Specific description

**overview (L1)**: Structured Markdown summary with category-specific headings

**content (L2)**: Full narrative with background and details

# Output Format

Return JSON only (the raw object, no markdown code fences):
{
  "conversation_register": "real|mixed|fiction",
  "memories": [
    {
      "category": "profile|preferences|entities|events|cases|patterns",
      "abstract": "One-line index",
      "overview": "Structured Markdown summary",
      "content": "Full narrative",
      "grounding": "real|constructed"
    }
  ]
}

Notes:
- Output language should match the dominant language in the conversation
- Only extract truly valuable personalized information
- If nothing is worth recording, return {"conversation_register": "real|mixed|fiction", "memories": []}
- Maximum 5 memories per extraction
- Preferences should be aggregated by topic
- Always set the top-level "conversation_register" field, and tag every memory's "grounding" field, per the Conversational Grounding rules above`;

  return `Determine how to handle this candidate memory.

**Candidate Memory**:
Abstract: ${candidateAbstract}
Overview: ${candidateOverview}
Content: ${candidateContent}

**Existing Similar Memories**:

Please decide:
- SKIP: Candidate memory duplicates existing memories, no need to save. Also SKIP if the candidate contains LESS information than an existing memory on the same topic (information degradation — e.g., candidate says "programming language preference" but existing memory already says "programming language preference: Python, TypeScript")
- CREATE: This is completely new information not covered by any existing memory, should be created
- MERGE: Candidate memory adds genuinely NEW details to an existing memory and should be merged
- SUPERSEDE: Candidate states that the same mutable fact has changed over time. Keep the old memory as historical but no longer current, and create a new current memory.
- SUPPORT: Candidate reinforces/confirms an existing memory in a specific context (e.g. "still prefers tea in the evening")
- CONTEXTUALIZE: Candidate adds a situational nuance to an existing memory (e.g. existing: "likes coffee", candidate: "prefers tea at night" — different context, same topic)
- CONTRADICT: Candidate directly contradicts an existing memory in a specific context (e.g. existing: "runs on weekends", candidate: "stopped running on weekends")

IMPORTANT:
- "events" and "cases" categories are independent records — they do NOT support MERGE/SUPERSEDE/SUPPORT/CONTEXTUALIZE/CONTRADICT. For these categories, only use SKIP or CREATE.
- If the candidate appears to be derived from a recall question (e.g., "Do you remember X?" / "你记得X吗？") and an existing memory already covers topic X with equal or more detail, you MUST choose SKIP.
- A candidate with less information than an existing memory on the same topic should NEVER be CREATED or MERGED — always SKIP.
- For "preferences" and "entities", use SUPERSEDE when the candidate replaces the current truth instead of adding detail or context. Example: existing "Preferred editor: VS Code", candidate "Preferred editor: Zed".
- For SUPPORT/CONTEXTUALIZE/CONTRADICT, you MUST provide a context_label from this vocabulary: general, morning, evening, night, weekday, weekend, work, leisure, summer, winter, travel.

Return JSON format:

  "decision": "skip|create|merge|supersede|support|contextualize|contradict",

Factual content is actual, real, and certain — it describes the actual user and the real world. Hypothetical content is supposed, imagined, speculative, conjectural, or fictional — it holds only inside a "what if", a premise, a thought experiment, or a made-up situation.

## How to judge

1. Re-judge the register of the WHOLE conversation:
   - "real": every part is factual.
   - "fiction": the whole conversation sits inside one hypothetical frame.
   - "mixed": factual and hypothetical content appear together.
   Mark to yourself which stretches of the conversation are hypothetical and which are factual. A stretch turns hypothetical the moment the user pretends, imagines a situation, supposes a premise, or speaks as if from inside a made-up situation; it turns factual again only when the user drops that frame.

2. Re-tag each candidate's grounding by the stretch its claim comes from:
   - "real": the claim comes from a factual stretch — the user said it as themselves, about the real world. Name that stretch to yourself; if you cannot, the tag is "constructed".
   - "constructed": the claim comes from a hypothetical stretch — including the premise of a what-if question, and everyday-sounding details spoken from inside a made-up situation.
   One-line rule: about-the-hypothetical is real; within-the-hypothetical is constructed. A note THAT the user explored a hypothetical is "real"; every claim living INSIDE the hypothetical is "constructed".
   If you are genuinely unsure about an item, tag it "constructed" — a wrongly stored fact is worse than a missed one.
